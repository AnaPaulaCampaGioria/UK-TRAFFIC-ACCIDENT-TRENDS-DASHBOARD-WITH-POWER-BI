## Features
- Data cleansing and preparation for accurate analysis.
- Yearly trend examination to identify changes in accident rates.
- Severity analysis to differentiate between fatal, serious, and slight casualties.
- Vehicle type categorization to understand the impact of different vehicles on accident statistics.
- Urban vs rural accident location analysis to highlight geographical safety disparities.
- Time-based incident distinction to explore the influence of time on accident occurrence.
- Interactive charts and maps for a user-friendly data experience.

## Visualizations
The dashboard includes several types of visualizations:
- Line and bar charts for trend analysis over months and years.
- Pie charts to represent the proportion of urban vs rural accidents.
- A map of the UK pinpointing specific accident locations.
- Donut charts illustrating the distribution of accidents by light conditions.
